        <ul>
            <li>Guide you in creating a Statement of Purpose.</li>
            <li>Allow you to define your values and beliefs.</li>
            <li>Inspire you to set goals that are in line with your statement.</li>

        <p>
            This is an assignment to create a brief verbal representation of “you” and who you hope to become. It should only be 3-4 sentences long.
        </p>

        <p>
            It is an idea to aspire to, it is a direction to go. It is not concrete and unmoveable, it is fluid, it is malleable.
        </p>
        <p>
            This Statement is not about creating a business plan or a list of things to complete. It is introspective, a way to see who you are at your core.
        </p>
        <p>
            Defining your values and beliefs will help you create this statement and then you can set goals that are in line with your statement.
