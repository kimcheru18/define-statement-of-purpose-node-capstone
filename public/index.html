                This is an assignment to create a brief verbal representation of “you” and who you hope to become. It should only be 3-4 sentences long.
            </p>

            <p>
                It is an idea to aspire to,  it is a direction to go. It is not concrete and unmoveable, it is fluid, it is malleable.
            </p>
            <p>
                This Statement is not about creating a business plan or a list of things to complete. It is introspective, a way to see who you are at your core.
            </p>
            <p>
                Defining your values and beliefs will help you create this statement and then you can set goals that are in line with your statement.
            </p>
