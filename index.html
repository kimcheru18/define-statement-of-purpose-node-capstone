		<p>
			This is an assignment to create a verbal representation of “you” and who you hope to become. It is an idea to aspire to,  it is a direction to go. It is not concrete and unmoveable, it is fluid, it is malleable.
		</p>  

		<p>
			Defining your values and beliefs will help you create this statement and then you may want to set goals that are in line with your statement.
		</p>
	<h3>Let's get started</h3>
		<p>
			To begin, you will answer several questions to get you thinking about who you are and what direction you want to go, then you can create your own statement in your own words or use a customizable template. 
		</p>
